## 🚚 File Migrations

| Old Location | New Location | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| `index.html` | `dashboards/bubbles/index.html` | ✅ Migrated |
| `src/app.js` | `dashboards/shared/js/app.js` | ✅ Migrated |
| `src/*.js` | `dashboards/shared/js/` | ✅ Migrated |
| `styles/main.css` | `dashboards/shared/css/main.css` | ✅ Migrated |
| `README.md` | `README.md` | ✅ Updated |

## 🔗 URL Changes

### Old URLs
- Main Dashboard: `index.html`

### New URLs
- **Dashboard Selector**: `index.html` (new landing page)
- **Bubbles Dashboard**: `dashboards/bubbles/index.html`
- **Packed Circle Dashboard**: `dashboards/packed-circle/index.html`

## 🛠️ Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility
- ❌ Direct links to old `index.html` will show the new dashboard selector
- ✅ All data files remain in the same location
- ✅ All functionality from the original dashboard is preserved

### Forward Compatibility
- ✅ New dashboard structure allows easy addition of more dashboards
- ✅ Shared components reduce code duplication
- ✅ Centralized configuration for easier maintenance

## 🔧 Developer Migration

### If you have local bookmarks:
**Update your bookmarks:**
- Old: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
- New: `http://localhost:8000/dashboards/bubbles/index.html` (for original dashboard)

### If you have custom modifications:
1. **CSS Changes**: Move custom styles to `dashboards/shared/css/main.css`
2. **JavaScript Changes**: Update import paths in your custom scripts
3. **Data Processing**: Check data file paths in configuration files

### Import Path Updates
```javascript
// Old
import { buildBubblePack } from './bubbles_pack.js';

// New (from dashboard directory)
import { buildBubblePack } from '../shared/js/bubbles_pack.js';
```

## 📊 New Features Available

## 🚀 Quick Start for Existing Users

### Option 1: Use Dashboard Selector (Recommended)
1. Open `index.html`
2. Choose "Bubbles Dashboard" for the familiar interface

### Option 2: Direct Access
1. Navigate directly to `dashboards/bubbles/index.html`
2. Experience is identical to the previous version

### Option 3: Try New Dashboard
1. Open `index.html`
2. Choose "Packed Circle Dashboard" for new visualization types

## 🔍 Testing the Migration

### Verify Original Functionality

- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable
- [ ] Animations are smooth

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Dashboard won't load"
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors. Verify you're running a local server (not file:// protocol).

### Issue: "Data not displaying"
**Solution**: Ensure data files are in the `Data/` directory and paths in config files are correct.

### Issue: "Styles look broken"
**Solution**: Clear browser cache and verify CSS file paths in HTML files.

### Issue: "Can't access original dashboard"
**Solution**: Use `dashboards/bubbles/index.html` for the original interface.
