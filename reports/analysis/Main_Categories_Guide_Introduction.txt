while neglecting the emotional and practical realities of modern motherhood.

The biggest opportunities lie in categories that address the WHOLE MOTHER EXPERIENCE:
- Her professional life (working mom support)
- Her emotional journey (connection and wellness)  
- Her need for authentic guidance (real testimonials)
- Her daily practical challenges (ease of cleaning)

Choose categories that position your brand as understanding the complete motherhood experience,
not just the pumping moment.
